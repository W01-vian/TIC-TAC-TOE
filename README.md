# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. 
## How to Play 
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is represented by 'X' and Player 2 is represented by 'O'.
3. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) in an empty cell.
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
## Compilation and Execution
   1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
   2. Save the source code in a file named `tic_tac_toe.cpp`.
   3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `tic_tac_toe.cpp`.
   4. Compile the source code using the following command: ```sh g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
